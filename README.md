    # get end user balance
    end_user_bal_resp = api.endUserBalance(mobile_number='077xxxxxxx')

    # get data bundles
    data_bundles_resp = api.getDataBundles()

    print("Wallet Balance: ")
    pprint.pprint(wallet_bal_response)

    print("End User Balance: ")
    pprint.pprint(end_user_bal_resp)

    print("Data Bundles Balance: ")
    pprint.pprint(data_bundles_resp)

except Exception as ex:

# Recharge
## Recharge data bundles
- use bundle product code
- an optional customer sms can be send together upon request
- Place holders used include
```
%AMOUNT% 	    $XXX.XX
%COMPANYNAME%	As Defined by Customer on the website www.hot.co.zw
%ACCESSNAME%	Defined by Customer on website â€“ Teller or Trusted User or branch name
%BUNDLE%	    Name of the Data Bundle
```
```python
import hotrecharge
from pprint import pprint

# you can opt to update the reference code manually 
# by setting `use_random_ref` to False
api = hotrecharge.HotRecharge(headers=credentials, use_random_ref=False)

try:

    # option message to send to user
    customer_sms =  " Amount of %AMOUNT% for data %BUNDLE% recharged! " \
                    " %ACCESSNAME%. The best %COMPANYNAME%!"

    # need to update reference manually, if `use_random_ref` is set to False
    api.updateReference('<new-random-string>')

    response = api.dataBundleRecharge(product_code="<bundle-product-code>", number="071xxxxxxx", mesg=customer_sms)

    pprint(response)

except Exception as ex:
    print(f"There was a problem: {ex}")
```

### Recharge pinless
```python
import hotrecharge

api = hotrecharge.HotRecharge(headers=credentials)

try:
    customer_sms = "Recharge of %AMOUNT% successful" \
                   "Initial balance $%INITIALBALANCE%" \
                   "Final Balance $%FINALBALANCE%" \
                   "%COMPANYNAME%"

    response = api.rechargePinless(amount=3.5, number="077xxxxxxx", mesg=customer_sms)

    print(response)

except Exception as ex:
    print(f"There was a problem: {ex}")
```

# New in `v1.3.0`âœ¨
- fully implemented method parameters e.g `brandID` and `mesg` for customerSMS on api method calls
### Query transaction
- You can now query a previous transaction by its `agentReference` for reconciliation. 
- It is reccommended to query within the last 30 days of the transaction
```python
import hotrecharge

api = hotrecharge.HotRecharge(headers=credentials)

try:
    response = api.rechargePinless(amount=3.5, number="077xxxxxxx")

    # save agentReference to query for reconciliation
    prevTransactionAgentReference = response.get("agentReference")

    result = api.queryTransactionReference(prevTransactionAgentReference)

    print(response, result)

except Exception as ex:
    print(f"There was a problem: {ex}")
```
